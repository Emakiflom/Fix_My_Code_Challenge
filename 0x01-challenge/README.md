# 0x01. Fix My Code

## Description

Fix My Code is a project where you'll dive into existing code bases and fix issues. Sometimes you'll be familiar with the language, other times not. The repository contains initial files for all solutions, and the goal is to fix existing code rather than rewriting it entirely.

This project is optional and not mandatory. Completing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. However, not doing it won't hurt your score, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
